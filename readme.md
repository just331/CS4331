# Project 1: Time Series Visualization of US Weapons Exports (1962-2017)
An interactive time series visualization of US weapon exports to countries, from 1962 to 1972

The web app can be viewed at https://just331.github.io/CS4331/ 

This application provides several means to analyze the data [Retrieved at: https://www.prio.org/Data/Mapping-Arms-Data/]
. Some of these features include: country selection by either checkbox of interactive map, which will pull the
data of a desired country upon clicking on said country. Once a country has been selected, the user will be able to 
see a line chart of the data and filter by year or value.


### Peak of 1995
One Interesting observation from the stacked bar graph is that you can clearly see exports from the United States 
clearly peaked in 1995. This was at a time of great conflict around the world, with civil wars spreading throughout
eastern Europe and the middle east. The visualization confirms this, by showing that a lot of the exports of weapons from
the U.S. were indeed going to those regions.

### The Gulf War 
Another interesting observation from the visualization is the increase in exports from the U.S. to other countries 
due to the start of the Gulf War in 1989-1990, to liberate Kuwait, after Iraq's annexation of the country. This was observed by looking at 
the line chart of the average value in exports, of all countries in a given year, by the United states. The average value
exports went from just shy of 1.6 million, sky rocketing to an average over 17 million from 1988 to 1989.
